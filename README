Open Source Firmware for Esp8266 based wifi devices that can be conntrolled by
Android app downloaded from Google Play Store at: 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safuiiot.abhi.wifiiotdevices

Following devices are currently supported: 

SWITCH, DIMMER, TIMER

User does not need to know ip address of device. Android app will discover all
local wifi devices running on this firmware using DNSSD and display them. On first
run, the device boots in Access Point mode, allowing Android devices to connect to
it using default password of 85128512 and configure wifi router ssid and password.

After this device reboots in Station mode and tries to connect to configured 
wifi router and hence should be available to Android app connected to wifi router. 


Device can again be forced to open Access Point on pressing button connected to
GPIO0. GPIO0 toggles wifi state of the device between Station mode and Access Point
Mode.

KNOWN BUG: 
      Due to Android NsdManager issue, after a change in wifi connection state app
      takes some time to discover devices this can be fastened by closing the app and
      opening again. NsdManager will be replaced by  jmdns to solve the issue.

      If devices are not visible in app even after proper configuration of wifi
      SSID and Password, just close the app from the navigation drawer exit button
      and relaunch the app. If still problem persits configuration is not ok.
